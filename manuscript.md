Depression is one of the major public health problems worldwide. WHO
reported that depression is the third leading cause of burden of disease
worldwide and the first leading causes in middle- and high- income
countries. They predicted that depression will be the first leading
cause of burden of disease worldwide in 2030.^[1] In Korea, depression is an important public health concern. Korea
ranked the first in suicide rate with nearly 30 deaths per 100000
population among Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development(OECD) countries^[2]. 

Depression is recurrent^[3], associated with increased
mortality^[4], and worsen physical, social, and role
functioning^[5]. Optimized Mental health policy needs to be
established to reduce the burden of disease and a reliable epidemiological survey
is essential to establish realistic and practical policies.

There are some nationwide epidemiological studies about the prevalence of
depression in Korea. The Korean Epidemiologic Catchment Area study 2011
using the Korean version of the Composite International Diagnostic
Interview 2.1(K-CIDI 2.1) reported that the lifetime prevalence of the major
depressive disorder is 6.7%, and 12-month prevalence of the major
depressive disorder is 3.1%^[6]. In 2001 and 2006, the
lifetime prevalence of the major depressive disorder is 4.3% and 5.6%,
respectively^[7][8]. The 12-month prevalence
rates is 2.5% and 1.7%, respectively^[7][8].
However, The sampling of the subjects was carried out across just 10 or
12 catchment areas and they include only several thousand
participants. Those studies in 2001 and 2006 did not include individual
older than 65 years. Another epidemiological study showed that point
prevalence of the major depressive disorder is 3.6% ^[9]. But
the sample is composed of only 3719 subjects and they were interviewed by
telephone. There is another study that shows the prevalence of
depressive symptoms including larger sample size^[10]. But
there is a limit to the use of self-rating scale.

The aims of this study is to estimate the prevalence and incidence of
major depressive disorder in the Korean population using a national
patient sample provided by the Korean National Health Insurance Service.
